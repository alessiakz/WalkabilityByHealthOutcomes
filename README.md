## Links to Original Data:

As the data files are too large to store on GitHub, the raw data links are provided here:

* CDC, 500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2019: https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities-Places/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2019-relea/6vp6-wxuq
* EPA, Walkability Index: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/walkability-index 

## Project Objectives

This is an exploratory and association data analysis project. The goal of this study is to explore the association between the prevalence of chronic disease with a city's EPA assigned walkability score.

Some secondary questions of interest are:
 
* Which chronic diseases have a higher/lower association with walkability score?
* Which cities have the lowest rates of chronic disease? Which cities have the highest rates of chronic disease?
* Are there any trends in association between chronic disease and walkability score between states and regions?
